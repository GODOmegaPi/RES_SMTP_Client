# RES_SMTP_Client
The goal of this application is to send prank emails to a list of victim emails addresses.

Groups are generated based on your email list. You just need to specify the quantity of group by running the app with the number of group in argument.

Running the application with 10 groups :

```
java -jar RES_SMTP_Client-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 10
```

Note : groups should be have at least 3 emails addresses. Be sure to specify a valid quantity of groups based on your email list.

## Building application
You first need to clone the git repository :

```sh
git clone git@github.com:SoftEng-HEIGVD/Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2019-Labo-SMTP.git 
```

Make sure you have a working Maven installation and make the java jar with :

```sh
mvn package
```

## Setting up mock smtp server
I you just want to test this application without sending email you can use a mock server.

It will show you emails that would have been sent if used with a real email server.

We use [MockMock](https://github.com/tweakers/MockMock) inside a docker container.

How to set it up ?

You can build a new image of MockMock using the DockerFile in the MockMock folder.
Start by going into the MockMock folder and use the following command:

```
docker build . -t mockmockserver
```

Once this is done, you can start the server by using:

```
docker run -p 2525:2525 -p 8080:8080 mockmockserver
```
